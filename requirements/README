Virtualenv setup

Virtualenv lets you isolate python libraries from the global python 
installation and other python libraries.

If you want to develop with or on shoebot virtualenv and pip are a great
way of doing it.


To install a virtualenv environment:

$ virtualenv shoebot-env

Activate the virtualenv
$ source shoebot-env/bin/activate

Your prompt will then change

(shoebot-env) $



Global Requirments:

PyGtk doesn't support installation in a virtualenv and will need to be
installed using your usual package manager.

Once pygtk is installed, symlinks to it's libraries need to be created -
in ubuntu 12.10 run the following command in the virtualenv:

(shoebot-env) $ ln -sf /usr/lib/python2.7/dist-packages/{glib,gobject,cairo,gtk-2.0,pygtk.py,pygtk.pth} $VIRTUAL_ENV/lib/python2.7/site-packages




Install the shoebot requirements:

(shoebot-env) $ pip install -r requirements.txt


Install shoebot in virtualenv:

(shoebot-env) $ cd ..
(shoebot-env) $ python setup.py
